Access to various invoice prints is available from the menu **Sales > Invoices > Reports**.

The **Report - invoice** function is used to mass print sales invoices already entered into the system, according to the filters specified in the initial form. The first choice required is between temporary and final print: the difference between the two types is that the temporary one has no effect on the invoice status, while the printed or digital final print changes the document status to "Printed". The first filters shown are related to the header information of the documents, such as the invoice type, document number, and customer. In the "Advanced search" group box, you can select the invoice statuses to filter on and the project indicated in the document header.
In the *Item* group box, it is possible to filter not only by item code but also by other information related to the document body lines, such as barcode, item description, or if a project is linked to the item line.
To launch the print, once the desired filters are set, simply press the "Preview" button on the ribbon bar to get an on-screen print preview of the invoices. Remember that the print preview will not change the document status in any case. If it is necessary to print on paper or file, press the *Print* button.

The **Sling Billing** print allows obtaining a printout highlighting the debit, credit, and total of sales invoices.
In the initial form, it is possible to filter the invoices to analyze, using the same filters as for the invoice print. The print is divided into several macro sections where the debit, credit, and total breakdowns are always shown, along with the section totals. The breakdowns are by customers, revenue accounts, payments, and agents.

With the **Invoice list**, it is possible to print a list of invoices entered into the system.
The filters presented are the same as the previous prints, with the addition of the possibility to select an invoice sorting order by customer, invoice number, and invoice type. There is also the option to select two different types of prints: the *Summary* print shows a list of invoice headers, indicating the total amounts and the breakdown by due dates; the *Complete* print shows the details of the individual invoice lines, including quantities and values.

The **Turnover** report analyzes the sales revenue produced by all company invoices, showing the revenue value and the percentage impact of each printed line on the total.
In the initial form, some filters related to the document headers to extract are shown, similar to those of the reports already analyzed, but with some specific options for this report.
In the *Years for comparison* field, it is possible to indicate the fiscal years for which you want to make a comparison. In the *Options* group box, there are some flags to show some data and include or exclude certain types of item lines in the calculation. Checking the *Quantities* option will show the quantities of the individual lines in the print, in addition to the value. *Only coded items* will ensure that only *Coded item* type lines are considered, while “Also expense items” and “Also gift items” will include expense and gift type lines in the counts. The *Sorting mode* combo box allows you to choose the order in which the data will be shown among: customer description, customer code, or revenue amount. Finally, in the *Group* grid, it is possible to set the cascading groupings for the print. To populate the table, simply select the desired grouping in the *Properties* table and drag it to the grouping table. To clear the grouping table, press the *Remove groupings* button.

The **Sales statistics** print presents the same filter, option, sorting, and grouping possibilities as the previously seen *Turnover* report, except for the ability to compare different fiscal years. It provides two possible data views, selectable from the box at the top left of the ribbon bar. The first view, *Margins on list purchase cost*, compares the sold value to the relative list cost, indicating the margin value and percentage. The second view, *Margins on goods receipt cost from DDT*, compares the sold value to the cost indicated on the goods receipt movements recorded in the warehouse.

The **Recycle Reports** print presents the same filters as the other prints, plus new ones: it is possible to filter by Material type, Conai partner type, and electronic invoice status. It is also possible to Group the results by Material, Customer, or Item.
As with the other prints, you can proceed with the Preview or launch the Print using the respective buttons on the ribbon bar.
