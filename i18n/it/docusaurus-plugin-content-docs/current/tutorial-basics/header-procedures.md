The procedure for resuming items from a purchase order allows for partial evasion of the purchase order. All unfulfilled, not forcibly fulfilled, and partially fulfilled orders are proposed. In order for a purchase order to be fulfilled, it must be *Printed* and have a *Confirmation Date*.

In the document header, by pressing the **Evasion from Project** button, the form will open where it is possible to filter orders related to the document's supplier.

It is then possible to insert items into the order, fully or partially fulfilling an entire order or a line.

*Specific buttons*:

> **Search**: allows you to search for purchase orders;  
> **Execute**: allows you to transfer selected items;  
> **Select/Deselect All**: allows you to select/deselect all items from the list;  
> **Enable/Disable Only Selected Rows**: particularly useful for evasion through the grid; allows you to enable/disable flags for all selected rows.

:::note Note
The procedure retrieves all the data present in the order and as a result, the purchase conditions present in the order will be applied, even if they have currently changed.
